# BI-Course-Final-Project
My project I made at the end of the BI course
It is not finished properly .It is lacking a PowerBI report that I was planning to make but ran out of time due to complications on the Transform phase.
While it may seem trivial I made a system that is reporting on any change that is happening, not just the required ones by the teacher. This pulled my attention from the clock
and I when I realized I won't be able to finish it on time ,I was already halfway done. So I finished the transform part.
Even though my project wasn't officially done , I recieved a lot of praise from the teacher because of the complicated solutions and functionality I managed to write and use.
